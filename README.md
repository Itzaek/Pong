# Pong
 
This is a recreation of the pong (1972) game.

# How to play
There are two manually controlled players P1 and P2.
The left paddles are controlled with w and s.
The right paddles are controlled with up and down arrows.

1. Download the exe (windows only, but I can create more exports) here: https://github.com/Itzaek/Pong/tree/main/pong/builds
2. Run the exe

# Improvements
1. Angle spawn. Since the angle is randomized, I would like to avoid angles near the y axes to prevent the ball from bouncing up and down too much
2. Favor angle spawn after point taken. After a point is made, the ball should launch to the side that lost
3. Adding an AI
4. Add a play menu that gives an option between computer or player and a play to point option
